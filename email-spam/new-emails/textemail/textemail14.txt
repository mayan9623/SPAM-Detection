<http: //www.venturesity.com/challenge/id/370>     *Hi Vishal Bisht,* 
 We are just a few days away from the *#buildwithAWS learn up*
<http: //www.venturesity.com/challenge/id/370>. Get hooked onto our series

of #buildwithAWS learnups that grow your knowhow on the capabilities of
AWS. In order for your product, service or company to make a lasting
impression on the right audience, it requires that little extra something.
We in the industry, recognize that extra something as virtualization. 
 
 Let the professionals take you through the intricacies and detailed
journey around the Amazon Web Services Platform. Supercharge your company's
offerings, products and services by learning how to leverage the world's
most powerful cloud platform. Along with Docker & AWS let us show you the
mastery and techniques to seamlessly growing your company and engaging your
audiences more. 
 
 What do I stand to learn from here? This session take you through the
concept of virtualization which would include the different types of
virtualizations, understanding the Docker as a software containerization
platform like Docker's Architecture, building and running custom images in
Docker containers and Networking Docker Containers. 
 
*Advantages of using Docker:*   - Simplicity and faster configurations
  - Increased productivity
  - Rapid Deployment
