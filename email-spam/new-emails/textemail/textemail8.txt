<p>Dear film lover,</p>
                        
                       <p>We are excited to bring to you an IMDb experience catered to the interests of the millions of movie & TV fans in India. Today we launched <a href="www.imdb.com/india">www.imdb.com/india</a>. Now, in addition to using IMDb as the authoritative destination for international films and TV shows, you can rely on us as an entertainment destination that will keep you up to date on the latest and greatest Indian movies.</p>
                        <p>Bookmark <a href="www.imdb.com/india/trending">www.imdb.com/india/trending</a> or download the IMDb app to stay current with “What’s Trending in India” across upcoming movies and celebrities, updated daily.</p>
                        <p>You can now plan your movie nights based on the “IMDb Top Rated Indian Movies” list that includes movies in Hindi, Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu, and Bengali. The list is ranked by a rigorous formula which includes the number of ratings each movie received among other criteria. To complement the movie recommendations based on inputs from IMDb users, you will also discover recommendations based on our editors picks. Our editors put me through an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/india/quiz/qz1562240989">Amitabh Bachchan quiz<a/> today. I scored a measly 5/10 – clearly I have more Big B movie watching to do.</p>
                        <p>I am proud and humbled to see millions of people across the world using IMDb everyday. IMDb was born out of my personal film diary and lifelong obsession with cinema. IMDb’s first version was the simple database I created on my computer of every film I saw since the age of 13. I encourage you to visit IMDb and join the community of passionate movie fans across the world. I have 234 Indian movies on my watchlist currently, and my most memorable Indian film is <ahref="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1187043/">3 Idiots (2009)</ahref>. What is yours? Tell us using the hashtag #IMDbIndia </p>
                        <p>Cheers,</br>
